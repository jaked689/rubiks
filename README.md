To use this program, one must enter the unique combination on that cube. It will ask for each face at a time, and enter either W, B, O, G, R, or Y depending on the first letter of the color. Enter these number from top to bottom, left to right. For the white face, make sure the blue face is on the bottom and the green face is on the top. For the yellow face, make sure the blue face is on the top and the green face is on the bottom. For the other four faces, make sure the white face is on top and the yellow is on bottom.

When actually solving the cube, make sure the blue face is facing you at all times. The commands will be given to you using the standard Rubik's cube notation.

To ease on readability, the code is split up into 11 parts, where progress should be made every time.
